- To Run the app do
- pip install -r requirements.txt uvicorn main:app --reload

To train a model
**- python scripts/train.py**

Limited Features
The model may be using insufficient or non-optimal features, such as relying only on residuals (residual_high, residual_low, residual_close) and SMA values. While these features may capture basic price dynamics, they might not fully represent market conditions.

Additional Features
- Trading volume
- Volatility
- External macroeconomic indicators

Solutions
- Enrich the feature set with more relevant data, such as:
- Technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
- Fundamental features (e.g., earnings reports)
- Noise in the Data
- Stock prices are inherently noisy and influenced by external factors (e.g., news, global events, market sentiment) that are not captured in historical data or the model's features.

Contributing Factors
- Unpredictable external events
- Missing features in the dataset
  
Solutions
- Accept that some error is inevitable due to the stochastic nature of stock prices.
- Focus on optimizing MAE within reasonable limits rather than aiming for perfect predictions.
